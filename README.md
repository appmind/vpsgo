[ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](README_ZH.md)

## üîÆ Vision

`vpsgo` wants to be the simplest VPS service management tool. To manage VPS and servers, you can use various commands, web-based control panels, or use vpsgo.

## üì° Overview

`vpsgo` is a CLI tool developed in golang that helps you manage VPS services more simply and easily.

As we all know, VPS is a remote server. Usually you need to use ssh remote login to configure and manage it. You must be familiar with various operating commands, understand the server system and related characteristics, and have script programming skills to be competent in server management. Moreover, the related work is very tedious, time-consuming, laborious and full of risks. Now, you don‚Äôt need to care about all of these because of vpsgo.

vpsgo integrates the best practices of server management and is developed using the cloud service development language Golang. vpsgo is committed to bringing you a light, simple, and efficient server management experience, reducing your mental burden and releasing your productivity.
